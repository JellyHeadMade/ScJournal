            <div className='about-text-body'>This is a fan project that has no official support of cloud imperium games. The stories on this site also do not reflect actual lore of the game. This site is here to allow fans of the projects to 
                have a common place to share their stories and experiences. while at the moment there is no firm rules i think there are a few that should be pretty obvious but will say them to be sure. This site 
                is for STAR CITIZEN STORIES. so the story should take place or revolve around the Star citizen IP. One should also keep all elements of the story in the IP as well. this is not saying using 
                terminalogy used in other scifi properties is not allowed, more as it should still relate to something that exsist in Star citizen. for example, if you refer to the Scorpius as the X-Wing i think 
                that is fine overall, as everyone would know what your talking about. if you start mentioning the force, or characters from other IP's that is grounds for the removal of the story. this is another 
                that should go without saying but zero tolorance for any type of harrasment of any singular or group of people, as well as no racial, sextual, or IRL political speech. this goes even for those who
                are appart of a certian race, sextuality, as trying to enforce only the "wrong" people from using that language is a moderation nightmare. lastly remember this is a place to just share stories of 
                your play experince with star citizen. so lets keep it to that and have a great time! any questions or concerns please feel free to contact me with the form below. Thanks!
